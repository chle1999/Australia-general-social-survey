# STA304 Australia-general-social-survey
Overview

Data on estimation of Australian people’s wellness status for both year 2019 and 2020 was downloaded from the website of Australian Bureau of Statistics and analyzed while it was published as the result of the [Australian General Social Survey](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/general-social-survey-summary-results-australia/2020). The main purpose of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and Australian’s mental wellness status, as the result should provide assistance for the government to initiate mental health programs that would effectively ease the stress brought by unprecedented global crisis such as the pandemic. With this, there were two major findings discussed in this report: 1) the number of people who encounter at least one stressor in the past 12 months has increased by 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, while females are more likely to feel more stressful during the COVID-19 pandemic 2) people did expressed more trust in the health system and towards others regardless of the protests and strict stay-at-home orders. The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/chle1999/Australia-general-social-survey/blob/main/ouput/Australia-general-social-survey.pdf)
