# STA304 Australia-general-social-survey

##Overview

This report aims to examine and analyze 15 survey questions and their results presented under the “Wellness” section on the Australian General Social Survey (AGSS) website, and the effect of the pandemic is incorporated in time using R. The difference between people’s responses between 2019 and 2020 is examined to conduct the analysis, which is pre-pandemic and during the pandemic.

The paper includes the following sections: a data section where more details on the AGSS and the data cleaning process will be explained; a result section where the key results will be explained in detail; a discussion selection that outlines the limitations and future outlooks; an additional survey created for the purpose of this research to gain further insight into the relationship between pandemic and wellbeing.


There were two major findings discussed in this report: 1) the number of people who encounter at least one stressor in the past 12 months has increased by 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, while females are more likely to feel more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic 2) people did express more trust in the health system and towards others regardless of the protests and strict stay-at-home orders.

The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/chle1999/Australia-general-social-survey/blob/main/ouput/Australia-general-social-survey.pdf).
